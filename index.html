                    <p id="reviewQuote">"I went solar with Shine this summer and it has been a great experience! Their
                        original proposal for how much money I would save has been spot on. My billing cycle with the
                        local
                        utility was a little funny for the first 2 months after installation (a 10 day cycle, then a 50
                        day
                        cycle), but on my first normal cycle my electric utility bill was only $13. My utility payment
                        plus
                        my solar loan payment is less than I was paying for electricity before. Better yet, when my
                        solar
                        loan is paid off I'll ONLY be paying roughly $13 per month for my electricity! Shine Solar was
                        great
                        to work with and everything they told me would happen has happened just as they said it would."

                <p class="faqParagraph">Can I get started with a few panels for a smaller system and then add more
                    later? Yes, you totally can sometimes it's viable to have some solar rather than no solar at all,
                    because solar always ends up being cheaper than the utility company. What we do is install a bigger
                    inverter that will be able to handle a larger amount of wattage when you do decide to have more
                    panels in the future. That way you already have your inverter that you need when you add more panels
                    and it's an easy process for you to install.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">How long does install take?</p>
                <p class="faqParagraph">How long does the installation take? Our average install takes about a day,
                    right? A bigger system is going to take a day and a half to two days, but the average is about a
                    day. That includes the installers installing the [rucking 00:00:18], the panels, the inverter, the
                    disconnect, the electricians doing the wiring, and us getting everything ready for the utility to
                    come out and swap out your meter with a net meter, so you can send your extra power back to them and
                    they can pay you for it. About a day. It's really easy.</p>

                <p class="faqParagraph">Do I need a permit to install a solar system on my house? An electrical permit?
                    Sometimes the answer's yes, sometimes the answer is no. It al depends on where you live. If you're
                    inside city limits more than likely yes. If you're outside of city limits, sometimes you might need
                    a county permit, but the bottom line is you will never have to do any of this yourself. We take care
                    of all of it for you. Our master electrician goes and pulls the permit. We do it all on the inside,
                    you guys don't have to pay for it or worry about it at all. It's a super easy process here that we
                    take care of.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion"> Does it need to go on roof?</p>
                <p class="faqParagraph">The roof is definitely the most common place that we see solar panels mounted.
                    The biggest reason for that, are the space constraints. Most people aren't equipped with huge
                    amounts of land and the actual space that it would take to put a full solar array on. The other
                    advantage is that, it's on the roof. It's untouched, it's un-bothered and it does its job. Although,
                    most of them are on the roof, they don't have to be. There are ground mounts, there are pole mounts,
                    there are several other options. In most of these cases, there's additional costs for ground mounts
                    or pole mounts, as there's way more labor involved. You've got concrete involved, you have way more
                    racking involved. So there's several pieces there that change the financial economics of the deal a
                    little bit. The most common route is the roof, but it doesn't have to be that way. It can be a
                    ground mount or a pole mount depending on the space that you have available. We recommend the roof
                    just because it's the cheapest, it makes the most financial sense. It gives you the fastest return
                    on your investment and most of the time, it goes untouched and un-bothered from anything that can
                    have access to the ground.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">Do I need a battery?</p>
                <p class="faqParagraph">Do I need a battery backup for my solar system? We can totally get it for you,
                    we just do not recommend it for two reasons. Number one, with net metering, the utility company you
                    can use as a natural battery backup to send all of your extra power back to them, and in some
                    states, according to the law, they have to pay you for that extra power you send back to them. They
                    don't write you a check for it, but they do pay you in the form of bill credits, and so when you
                    send your extra power to them, your meter literally spins backwards. So not only is it free to stay
                    with the power company as your battery backup, but on top of that they pay you in the form of bill
                    credits to do it. Number two reason why we don't recommend it is technology on batteries right now
                    is just still very new and because of that the cost is just super high. For a five kilowatt battery
                    you're running anywhere between $5,500 and $7,000, and with the average system size being higher
                    than that, it's going to totally wipe out your savings. It's just not cost-effective right now. The
                    good news is net metering as a natural battery for you, and then on top of that, when batteries do
                    get cheaper in the future, you already made the first step. You already got a solar system, now you
                    can purchase a battery at a respectable price, at a reasonable price, and add it right to your solar
                    system and you're good to go.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">How long is the warranty?</p>
                <p class="faqParagraph">The industry standard for solar panel manufacturers is a 25 year linear
                    production warranty. All of the panels and equipment that we use have that same standard warranty. A
                    linear production warranty is literally guaranteeing the production of the panels over the course of
                    25 years. There's a degradation schedule assigned, that the panels will obviously lose some
                    efficiency over time, but with that we outline exactly how much your system will produce on a
                    monthly basis over the next 25 years. The 25 year linear production warranty is literally something
                    that is tied to the panels, not the home owner. So if you move down the road, or there's a new home
                    owner, or whatever the case is, you don't have to worry about anything. It's literally with the
                    panels, and we monitor the system for the life of the panels. So literally if a panel ever stops
                    producing the amount of energy that it's supposed to based on that linear production warranty at the
                    time you purchased the system, then we will come and swap out the panels, no questions asked. We
                    handle all the warranty claims if there are any, and we will literally come swap out the panel, put
                    the new panel on, and handle everything with the manufacturer. There's literally zero maintenance or
                    upkeep expected from the consumer for solar panels.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">How many panels do I need?</p>
                <p class="faqParagraph">This is one of the things that's unique about solar. That's not a standard
                    system size or system layout or system design for every single home. The way that your system size
                    is determined, has 100% to do with how much power you consume, and how much roof space you have.
                    What doesn't matter is the square footage of your home or how many people live in your home, or any
                    of those factors. It really just comes down to how much power you use. You can have two homes that
                    are the exact same size, and what might have a family of six, where the other has a family of two or
                    three, and each of those homes are going to consume a different amount of power. What we do, with
                    every single on our customers, the first step is, we look at the last twelve months of how much
                    power you've used. We get copies of your electric bills, or have you give us the kilowatt hour
                    amounts, or whatever it is, so that we can determine exactly how much power your home consumes. Once
                    we know that, we can determine exactly how many solar panels you need and then based on how much
                    roof space you have, the shading around your roof, if it's East facing or West facing or South
                    facing, and exactly how much sun those solar panels are going to receive, we can determine exactly
                    how many panels you're going to need, what the system size is, and ultimately what the cost of the
                    project is and the savings that you're going to see right out of the gate, month one. Then over the
                    next five years, ten years, twenty five years.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">What About Hail?</p>
                <p class="faqParagraph">What happens if it hails? I get this question all the time. You have to keep in
                    mind that these solar panels are engineered and built to go on top of roofs, and to go on fields and
                    solar farms for literally decades, right? It'd be pretty silly if the engineers didn't have that in
                    mind. They're going to get pounded with the elements over the next 25 to 40 years while you have
                    your solar system. They're engineered to handle all the regular stuff. The rain, hail, wind, sleet,
                    snow, whatever it might be, right? They are hail tested with two inch wide hail balls being shot at
                    them at 75 miles an hour. It's actually pretty neat how they're tested. I'm standing next to a solar
                    panel right here. It's got a tempered glass coating over it, and you can kind of compare it to a car
                    windshield, right? If it starts hailing and you're driving down the road, it's totally fine. It's
                    going to handle it. Now, if something happens that's crazy, right? Maybe baseball size hail, rarely
                    happens right? But, that might do some damage to your solar panels, or what if a tornado rips off
                    your roof, your panels go with it? What if a lightning bolt hits your solar panels, and fries the
                    whole system? That's all covered by your homeowners insurance. Homeowners insurance will cover any
                    acts of God, any extreme acts of God. They do it for anywhere between nothing, and about 60 bucks a
                    year. A super minimal expense. I've had some customers, they haven't increased it at all. I've had
                    some customers that increased by three bucks a month. The ones that don't increase it at all, we
                    asked them why. Really you can kind of compare it to doing an upgrade to your kitchen, like a
                    $20,000 makeover to your kitchen. Your homeowners insurance isn't going to go up, right? It's only
                    if you do square footage additions to the home. If you have a rooftop solar system that's going on
                    top of the home and it's not a ground mount in the backyard, very minimal expense between nothing
                    and 60 bucks a year. That covers any crazy acts of God, but anything else you guys, on the regular
                    stuff, these things are strong.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">What is Net Metering?</p>
                <p class="faqParagraph">Net metering is a term used in the solar industry primarily by the utility
                    companies. What’s happening is once you have solar panels on your roof, you’re going to have a
                    different meter on your home than the one you currently use. The meter you currently use just turns
                    one direction and that’s forward. That’s power that you’re buying from the utility that they're then
                    billing you on later. With a net meter literally what’s happening is sometimes you’re going to be
                    buying power from the utility if your solar is not producing enough for your home’s needs at that
                    time, and there’ll be other times when your home is producing more power than what you need and that
                    excess power is literally turning the meter backwards, feeding the power back into the grid. Net
                    metering is the way that the utility is going to bill you. You’re going to have the total amount of
                    power you used, minus how much you produced, and you’re going to get billed on that difference.
                    That’s the net meter. So literally what’s happening is we’re tracking how much power comes into the
                    home, we’re tracking how much power leaves the home back into the grid, and that’s how the utility
                    company knows how to bill you going forward. It’s a great concept, because it’s able to give you
                    full credit for any power that you generate yourself. There are going to be times at night, on
                    cloudy days, rainy days, whatever it is, when your solar panels are not going to be producing
                    sufficient power. There’s going to be other times when you’re overproducing and you have an excess
                    amount of power. Rather than have that power go to waste, net metering is the concept and the way
                    that the utility has structured, so that you actually get credit for the power that you’ve
                    generated, it goes back into the grid, you get a credit and then later as you pull power from the
                    grid, you’ve already offset that on your bill because you generated it previously.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">What About Weight on my Roof?</p>
                <p class="faqParagraph">Will the solar panels affect the structural and integrity of my roof? The answer
                    is no. It actually makes it stronger. I'll explain why in a couple different ways. Number one
                    underneath the panels on top of the roof we install a racking system, and the racking system lays
                    horizontally, and underneath your roof are the rafters, and those run vertically. You're actually
                    distributing the weight of the panels over a lot bigger of a range with the horizontal and vertical
                    going together and working together. The panels themselves are about 40 pounds each but laying on
                    top of that racking system and being attached to it that weight is being distributed over a wide
                    range at about 4 pounds per square foot so 4 pounds plus or minus a tiny bit. So, the answer is no 4
                    pounds per square foot is not going to do anything and the racking combined with the rafters
                    underneath it, it actually makes it a little bit stronger.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">Will I Have Power When The Grid Goes Down?</p>
                <p class="faqParagraph">If the grid goes down and I have a solar system, am I still going to have power?
                    The answer's no. Your solar system's going to go down, too. The reason why is because of safety
                    concerns. The utility company actually requires your solar system to be shut off when their grid
                    goes down. If they have guys working on the utility lines while your solar system is producing a
                    live feed, they could get shocked and electrocuted. It's a safety concern. If you're thinking what
                    if the power goes out for multiple days at a time? We recommend simply a generator for those
                    situations just because it's a lot more cost effective than getting a battery backup. Battery is
                    going to wipe out all of your savings associated with going solar. We're looking to save you money
                    the 99.9% of the time that you do have power, and the best way to do that is by staying grid tied.
                    When the power goes down, you will too. Just know that. If more information on battery backups, look
                    at our other video that explains battery backup systems and why we don't recommend them at this
                    time. It explains it a lot more in detail.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">What Incentives are Available?</p>
                <p class="faqParagraph">This is one of the most popular questions we get and frankly one of the biggest
                    reasons why people are going solar. There's a 30% federal tax credit available for anyone that puts
                    solar panels on their roof. This is a tax credit not a tax rebate, so it literally directly offsets
                    any tax liability that you owe to the IRS. The way it's calculated is it's simply 30% of the total
                    cost of the solar system. When you go to file your taxes next year, whatever your tax liability is
                    that number will come right off the top. It simply money that you were already going to pay to the
                    IRS, that now you can use towards your own home, towards your solar system, which is going to
                    provide you power long term and it actually appreciate the value of your home. This is one of the
                    biggest reasons why people are going solar right now is because 30% of it is paid for by the
                    government. In the past it hasn't always made a ton of sense to go solar because it's been an
                    expensive project with as much as a solar panel costs have come down and the tax credit that's in
                    place it's made it so that it makes more financial sense and it's creating a lot of urgency so that
                    more people are doing it. Ultimately when a tax credit runs out it's over solar will still make
                    sense but obviously when somebody can pay 30% of it for you it makes a lot more sense. That's the
                    situation were in right now.</p>

                <p class="faqQuestion">Is solar power different?</p>
                <p class="faqParagraph">Will I have to buy new appliances when I get my solar system installed? Or, how
                    is the power going to be different from regular power that I get from the grid? The answer is
                    simply: AC power, alternating current power, is AC power, right? The solar panels are turning a
                    direct current that they produce into an AC current that your home uses for power. It's the same AC
                    electrical current that you're pulling from the grid. Solar power doesn't look any different from
                    grid power, and so, no, everything stays the same. All your power looks the same.</p>
